Enter alert description:
Apple Black Rot, caused by the Neonectria ditissima fungus, has been reported in apple orchards across the Waterloo region. The disease primarily affects the fruit and leaves, leading to dark, sunken lesions that can eventually rot the affected parts of the apple. The infection spreads rapidly during wet conditions, particularly in areas with high humidity. Early signs include water-soaked lesions on the fruit's surface, followed by darkening and softening.

Farmers are advised to monitor their orchards closely, remove infected fruits and leaves, and apply appropriate fungicides to limit the spread of the disease.
